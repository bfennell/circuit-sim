# circuit-sim
C++ Implementation of the Scala example at:  https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/wikla/OTS/Sisalto/examples/html/ch18.html#sec5

Goal was to implement the circuit simulation example, from the Programming in Scala book, in C++ using the same programming techniques.

Result is that the all the concepts from the example map easily to C++
